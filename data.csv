Their comfortable fit and lightweight build make them suitable for extended listening sessions. 

The sound quality is rich, with clear highs and deep bass, making them versatile for various music genres. Active noise cancellation is effective, allowing for a more immersive experience in noisy environments. Battery life is commendable, with quick charging capabilities that add to their convenience.
Spatial audio feels a little bit low.

The touch controls are responsive, and the integration with voice assistants works seamlessly.

It's only con is it makes a weird buffing noise initially and in longer uses session it hurts a little bit to the ear.

Overall, the CMF by Nothing Buds Pro 2 offers excellent value for the price, appealing to both casual listeners and audiophiles looking for a stylish and functional pair of earbuds."

Standout features:
Mic Quality
Smart Dial ofc

Pros:
Lightweight and pocket friendly 
Sound qlty. (Bass is too loud and punchy. Not a big fan of the bass though)
Noise cancellation.
Faster Pairing.
Battery Life

Neutral:
App Functions and experience and Customization

Cons:
It's irritating to carry the case around at all times just to adjust volume also single touch does nothing they should have used the function.
ANC keeps on changing modes even when you've set it to a specific mode. 
Equalizer doesn't give you enough options to meddle around to your specific settings.
One of the bud will stop working once you take out from the case and put it in your ears but will get normal after 20-30 seconds or you've to take it out of your ears and put it in again.

Overall it's one of the best deal under Rs4000 price point."

Great sound, great value!

Honestly, didn‚Äôt expect this level of sound quality at this price. The bass is punchy without being overwhelming, vocals are clear, and the ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) is surprisingly effective even in metro and office environments.

Battery life easily gets me through 3‚Äì4 days of casual use, and the case looks super sleek. Touch controls work well, though there‚Äôs a bit of a learning curve in the beginning.

Mic quality is also good on calls, even with background noise. Just make sure to get the right fit with the ear tips ‚Äì it makes a big difference.

Overall, if you‚Äôre looking for budget-friendly earbuds that feel premium, CMF Buds Pro 2 is a solid choice. Just go for it!"

After using them daily for the past 6 months, I can honestly say: they‚Äôre worth every penny. The 50dB Active Noise Cancellation is no joke ‚Äì they block out everything. Planes, traffic, noisy caf√©s? Gone. Just pure, uninterrupted sound.

And that Hi-Res audio? Crystal clear, with deep bass and crisp highs. Whether I‚Äôm listening to music, podcasts, or hopping on calls, the sound quality is chef‚Äôs kiss.

‚úÖ Battery still going strong
‚úÖ Super comfortable ‚Äì even for long wear

‚úÖ Sleek, premium design

If you want wireless buds that actually deliver ‚Äì these are it. 6 months later, and I still catch myself smiling every time I put them in.
